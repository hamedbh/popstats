Title: Calculate Population Statistics in R
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: person(given = "Hamed", 
                  family = "Bastan-Hagh", 
                  email = "hamed@bastanhagh.com", 
                  role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: By default R will calculate variance and standard deviation with 
    N - 1 as the denominator. Functions in popstats will calculate using N as 
    the denominator, i.e. the population rather than sample variance/standard 
    deviation.
